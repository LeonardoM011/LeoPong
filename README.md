# LeoPong

My twist on pong videogame

## What exactly is LeoPong?

LeoPong is a 2D Game made with my Kobe2D Game Engine written in C++ including GLFW Library for Window Managment and GLEW Library for Modern OpenGL. This is my First Real Attempt at making a Real Video Game made from scratch. This is completly Open Source and anyone can modify it and do whatever he wants with it. It uses Microsoft's Visual Studio IDE for Developing and Debugging. 

## How to build it?

###### Windows

Install Visual Studio from [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/), navigate to the LeoPong repository folder and open solution file. 

\*_Important!_
_Change Platform from x64 to **x86** even if you're using x64 Operating Sytem_

And just build the project.

###### Linux

I will make a tutorial on how to setup LeoPong on Linux in the near future since i no longer use Ubuntu. 

Feel free to contribute.
